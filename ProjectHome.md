Abstract Taboo

1) Name of the project:
Graboo

2) A version number:
Rev. 0.1

3) A written abstract on the project. Max 100 words:
The idea was to create a game that deals with taboo in an abstract manner. The different objects in the game are in a constant flux, and it is up to the player to only handle the objects that are not taboo to him. At the same time, he has to push the taboos of the other player into his zone, in order to make him loose his mana. The player wins by either maximixing his own mana by picking up non-taboo objects or by depleting the other players mana.

8) A brief play description if nescesary.
Control your character with the left stick and use the visuals to decide how much mana you posses. Each player has one taboo at any given time. Defend your zone from the taboo and do not pick it up! But beware, taboos constantly change and are not the same for each player. Use L1 to grab the objects floating on the screen when they are safe and throw them towards your own zone.Take the offensive stance by throwing your opponents taboo towards him. When under attack, block the taboos with L2, but use this skill  wih caution as it will slowly deplete your mana. You win by depleting the opponents mana pool or maxing out your own.
